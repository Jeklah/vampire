The Sole Survivor

* Starting date:        Miocene Epoch (around the time of the first huamns evolving).

* Cause:                Bat virus wiping out a newly evolving race (humans) when a virus transmitted by being bitten by bats infects the
                        group and quickly spreads, driving most humans into blood thirsty savages (having recently evolved from apes).
                        You are the sole survivor of this massacre, although you have been infected, it appears to have affected you
                        differently, you became stronger, faster (etc) which helped you fight off the infected that had turned into savages
                        thus, making you the sole survivor of this incident, which also makes you the original vampire.
