# Vampire RPG: The First Immortal

A cross-platform 2D vampire RPG built with Rust and Macroquad, featuring pixel art graphics and atmospheric night environments. Runs identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Inspired by the concept of being the original vampire surviving through different epochs of human history.

## Story

You are the sole survivor of a viral outbreak during the Miocene Epoch that transformed early humans into blood-thirsty savages. Unlike the others, the virus affected you differently - you became stronger, faster, and immortal, but with an insatiable thirst for blood and vulnerability to sunlight. As the original vampire, you must survive, adapt, and eventually rule or unite the savage clans that emerged from the infected.

## Game Phases

The game progresses through four distinct phases:

### Phase 1: Survival and Discovery
- **Objective**: Learn your vampire nature and survive the hostile world
- **Gameplay**: Explore, feed on blood sources, avoid sunlight, discover abilities
- **Key Mechanics**: Blood management, day/night cycle, basic combat

### Phase 2: Clan Encounters  
- **Objective**: Make contact with and influence the three main clans
- **Gameplay**: Diplomacy, combat, or deception to gain followers
- **Clans**:
  - **Bone-Eaters**: Brute force specialists (Leader: Grimjaw)
  - **Flame-Haters**: Shadow-dwelling pyrophobes (Leader: Shadowmere)
  - **Night-Bloods**: Stealth hunters (Leader: Silentfang)

### Phase 3: Empire Building
- **Objective**: Build your vampire empire and unite the clans
- **Gameplay**: Territory control, resource management, clan politics

### Phase 4: World Reaction
- **Objective**: Face the consequences of your actions and choose your legacy
- **Gameplay**: Deal with hunters, uncover ancient truths, transcend mortality

## Controls

- **WASD**: Move your character
- **R**: Feed on nearby entities (restores blood and health)
- **E**: Interact with clan leaders (increases trust)
- **Space**: Attack hostile infected enemies
- **Tab**: Toggle clan relations menu
- **L**: Toggle legend (shows what all entities mean)
- **H**: Toggle quick start guide
- **Esc**: Pause/unpause game
- **Ctrl+Q**: Quit game

## Core Mechanics

### Blood System
- **Blood Meter**: Your primary resource that drains over time
- **Feeding**: Approach weak enemies or animals and press R to feed
- **Starvation**: Low blood causes health damage and ability penalties
- **Benefits**: Feeding improves your vampire abilities over time

### Day/Night Cycle
- **Daylight Damage**: Being in sunlight during day causes continuous damage
- **Movement Penalty**: Reduced movement speed during daylight hours
- **Time Display**: Current time and day counter shown in UI
- **Strategic Planning**: Plan activities around the night cycle

### Vampire Abilities
Abilities improve through feeding and experience:
- **Strength**: Increases combat effectiveness
- **Speed**: Improves movement speed
- **Blood Sense**: Enhanced detection of blood sources
- **Shadow Movement**: Advanced stealth capabilities (future feature)

### Visual Guide
The game features beautiful pixel art graphics with a comprehensive legend system:
- **Player**: Detailed vampire sprite with red cape and glowing eyes
- **Clan Leaders**: Pixel warriors with golden crowns and weapons
- **Hostile Infected**: Twisted creatures with red eyes and claws
- **Animals**: Cute pixel animals with ears and tails (blood sources)
- **Environment**: Starry night sky with a glowing moon
- **Effects**: Blood particle effects when feeding
- **Health Bars**: Color-coded bars above all entities (green/yellow/red)
- **Camera**: 1.5x zoom level for enhanced pixel art detail visibility

### Clan Relations
- **Trust System**: Build trust through positive interactions
- **Alliance**: Clans become allied when trust is high enough
- **Reputation**: Your actions affect how all clans perceive you

2. Build Windows executable:
```bash
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```
3. Find the `.exe` at: `target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/vampire-rpg.exe`

**On Windows:**
1. Install Rust from https://rustup.rs/
2. Navigate to the vampire directory
3. Run: `cargo run`

For optimized performance (all platforms):
```bash
cargo run --release
```

**Cross-Compilation:** See `CROSS_COMPILE.md` for detailed instructions, or run `./build-all.sh` to build both Linux and Windows versions.

## Architecture Overview

The game uses a simplified entity-component system with the following key structures:

### Core Components
- **Position/Velocity**: Movement and physics
- **Health**: Life points for all entities
- **BloodMeter**: Vampire-specific resource system
- **VampireAbilities**: Progressive power system

### Game Systems
- **TimeSystem**: Manages day/night cycles
- **BloodSystem**: Handles feeding, starvation, and sunlight damage
- **MovementSystem**: Updates entity positions
- **InteractionSystem**: Manages player interactions with NPCs

### Entity Types
- **Player**: The vampire protagonist
- **ClanLeader**: Important NPCs that can be allied with
- **HostileInfected**: Enemies that can be fed upon
- **Animal**: Passive blood sources
