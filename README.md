This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Vampire RPG project, covering architecture, development guidelines, and modularization details.

## 📚 Documentation Index

### [Modularization Summary](modularization-summary.md)
**Complete overview of the game state refactoring project**

- **What**: Transformation of monolithic `game_state.rs` into focused modules
- **Why**: Improved maintainability, testability, and code organization
- **How**: Applied Single Responsibility Principle and composition patterns
- **Results**: 700+ line file → 7 focused systems with enhanced functionality

**Key Highlights**:
- 60% reduction in main coordinator file size
- 300% increase in test coverage
- Zero breaking changes to core functionality
- Enhanced features added during refactoring

### [Technical Architecture](technical-architecture.md)
**Deep dive into the technical design and system architecture**

- **System Overview**: High-level architecture diagrams and data flow
- **Module Structure**: Detailed breakdown of each component
- **Design Patterns**: Architectural patterns and principles used
- **Performance**: Optimization strategies and scalability considerations
- **Dependencies**: Core libraries and their usage

**Key Sections**:
- Core design philosophy and principles
- System-by-system technical breakdown
- Data models and entity representation
- Performance optimization strategies
- Security and error handling approaches

### [Development Guidelines](development-guidelines.md)
**Comprehensive guide for developers working on the project**

- **Code Style**: Rust formatting and naming conventions
- **System Design**: How to create new systems and components
- **Testing**: Unit testing, integration testing, and quality standards
- **Documentation**: Writing effective code documentation
- **Performance**: Memory management and optimization guidelines

**Key Topics**:
- Code organization and formatting rules
- System design patterns and templates
- Error handling best practices
- Git workflow and code review process
- Debugging and profiling guidelines

## 🎯 Quick Start for Developers

### Understanding the Architecture

1. **Start Here**: Read [modularization-summary.md](modularization-summary.md) for project overview
2. **Technical Details**: Review [technical-architecture.md](technical-architecture.md) for system design
3. **Development**: Follow [development-guidelines.md](development-guidelines.md) for coding standards

### Key Architectural Concepts

- **Systems**: Focused modules handling specific game aspects (AI, Blood, Player, etc.)
- **Components**: Data structures representing entity properties
- **Coordinator**: GameState orchestrates system interactions
- **Entity-Component**: Flexible entity representation with optional components

## 🔧 System Design Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
Each system handles one specific aspect of gameplay:
- **TimeSystem**: Day/night cycle only
- **PlayerSystem**: Player actions and progression only
- **AISystem**: NPC behavior only

### 2. Composition over Inheritance
- GameState composes systems rather than inheriting behavior
- Systems are independent and easily replaceable
- Flexible architecture allowing system reuse

### 3. Dependency Injection
- Systems operate on data passed to them
- No hidden dependencies or global state
- Easy to test systems in isolation

### 4. Data-Driven Design
- Game behavior controlled by data, not hardcoded logic
- Configuration through components and parameters
- Easy to balance and modify game mechanics

## 📊 Code Quality Metrics
